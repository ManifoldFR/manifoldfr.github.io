Our paper *From centroidal to whole-body models for legged locomotion: a comparative analysis* with Ewen Dantec, has been accepted at the [2024 IEEE RAS Humanoids conference](https://2024.ieee-humanoids.org/) which will take place in Nancy, France in November.

In this paper, we investigate a comparison of using whole-body and two different reduced-order models for nonlinear model-predictive control on bipedal robots, using our optimal control library [aligator](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/aligator/) (which has recently reached 100 stars on GitHub!)

We will be there in November to present our work, and perhaps more ðŸ˜ƒ
