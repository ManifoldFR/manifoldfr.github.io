Our paper *Parallel and Proximal Linear-Quadratic Methods for Real-Time Constrained Model-Predictive Control* has been accepted at *Robotics: Science and Systems* (RSS) 2024!

It introduces a parallel direct method for solving the regularised linear system for the Newton step in either augmented Lagrangian *or* interior-point methods for nonlinear MPC.

I will be in Delft this week for the presentation on Tuesday morning.

Check it out [here](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss20/p002.html) from the programme.
