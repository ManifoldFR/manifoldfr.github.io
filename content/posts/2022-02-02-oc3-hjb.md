Consider once again an optimal control problem (OCP) in continuous time:
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{alignedat}{2}
    &\min_{x, u}{}&& \int_0^T \ell(x(t), u(t)) dt + h(x(T))  \\
    &\suchthat&& \dot{x} = f(x, u), \quad t \in [0, T)
\end{alignedat}
\end{equation}
$$

The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation takes the form of a partial differential equation:
$$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \min_{u\in\mathcal{U}}
    \big\{
        \ell(x, u) + \langle \nabla_x V(x, t), f(x, u)\rangle
    \big\} = 0
\end{equation}
$$
subject to the terminal condition $V(x, T) = h(x)$ for all $x \in \mathcal{X}$.

A solution of the HJB equation easily provides the optimal feedback control policy as the optimum of the inner minimization:
$$
\begin{equation}
    u_t^\star(x) = \argmin_{u} \{ \ell(x, u) + \langle \nabla_x V(x, t), f(x, u) \rangle \}.
\end{equation}
$$

At first hand, the HJB equation looks incredibly powerful. If one can easily find an expression for $u^\star$ as a function of the value gradient $\nabla_xV$, then we can formulate the PDE and solve it.
Then, we could recover a global optimal policy which will work for a whole range of initial conditions $x(0)$.

The inner function in the minimization is the continuous-time \\(  Q  \\)-function \\(  Q(x, u)  \\). Notice its resemblance to the Hamiltonian in the Pontryaguine minimum principle. Actually, we have
\\[
    Q(x, u) = \mathcal{H}(x, u, p=\nabla_x V(x, t))
\\]

However, the resulting PDE is nonlinear, and nonlinear PDEs are a very intensive field of research. The existence of solutions in itself is a question of importance, though Lions has introduced the notion of viscosity solutions which are shown to exist under mild assumptions.  
Numerical solutions can be investigated, for instance Galerkin or finite-difference methods (converging to the above viscosity solutions). These are only practial for low-dimensional systems (typically $d \leq 3$), if one can be satisfied with a grid that is not too large: the curse of dimensionality comes into play.
For higher-dimensional systems (one need only look at something as simple as a quadrotor), there is no really practical method.

## The LQR case

Let's remind ourselves of the continuous-time LQR model:
$$
\begin{equation}
    f(x, u) = Ax + Bu, \quad \ell(x, u) = \frac12 x^\top Qx + \frac12 u^\top Ru, \quad h(x) = \frac12 x^\top Q_f x
\end{equation}
$$
with a control space $\calU = \RR^{n_u}$.
Then, the minimizer and PDE are given by
$$
\begin{equation}
    u = -R^{-1}B^\top V_x,\quad
    \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac12 x^\top Qx + V_x^\top A x - \frac12 V_x^\top BR^{-1}B^\top V_x
\end{equation}
$$
Injecting \\( V(x,t) = \frac12 x^\top P(t)x \\) leads to a matrix differential equation after removing \\(  x  \\):
$$
\begin{equation}
    \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{
    \dot{P}(t) + Q + P(t)^\top A + A^\top P(t) - P(t)^\top BR^{-1}B^\top P(t)}, \quad P(T) = Q_f.
\end{equation}
$$
this equation is called the _matrix continuous Riccati equation_.
