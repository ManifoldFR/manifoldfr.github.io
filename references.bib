  abstract = {Model predictive control is one of the most common methods for stabilizing the dynamics of a legged robot. Yet, it remains unclear which level of complexity should be considered for modeling the system dynamics. On the one hand, most embedded pipelines for legged locomotion rely on reduced models with low computational load in order to ensure real-time capabilities at the price of not exploiting the full potential of the whole-body dynamics. On the other hand, recent numerical solvers can now generate whole-body trajectories on the fly while still respecting tight time constraints. This paper compares the performances of common dynamic models of increasing complexity (centroidal, kino-dynamics, and whole-body models) in simulation over locomotion problems involving challenging gaits, stairs climbing and balance recovery. We also present a 3-D kino-dynamics model that reformulates centroidal dynamics in the coordinates of the base frame by efficiently leveraging the centroidal momentum equation at the acceleration level. This comparative study uses the humanoid robot Talos and the augmented Lagrangian-based solver Aligator to enforce hard constraints on the optimization problem.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is an efficient approach for solving optimal control problems for complex robotic systems. It relies on two key components: first the transcription into a sparse nonlinear program, and second the corresponding solver to iteratively compute its solution. On one hand, differential dynamic programming (DDP) provides an efficient approach to transcribe the optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional problem while optimally exploiting the sparsity induced by time. On the other hand, augmented Lagrangian methods make it possible to formulate efficient algorithms with advanced constraint-satisfaction strategies. In this paper, we propose to combine these two approaches into an efficient optimal control algorithm accepting both equality and inequality constraints. Based on the augmented Lagrangian literature, we first derive a generic primal-dual augmented Lagrangian strategy for nonlinear problems with equality and inequality constraints. We then apply it to the dynamic programming principle to solve the value-greedy optimization problems inherent to the backward pass of DDP, which we combine with a dedicated globalization strategy, resulting in a Newton-like algorithm for solving constrained trajectory optimization problems. Contrary to previous attempts of formulating an augmented Lagrangian version of DDP, our approach exhibits adequate convergence properties without any switch in strategies. We empirically demonstrate its interest with several case-studies from the robotics literature.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) method has gained in maturity and popularity within the robotics community. Several recent contributions have led to the integration of constraints within the original DDP formulation, hence enlarging its domain of application while making it a strong and easy-to-implement competitor against alternative methods of the state of the art such as collocation or multiple-shooting approaches. Yet, and similarly to its competitors, DDP remains unable to cope with high-dimensional dynamics within a receding horizon fashion, such as in the case of online generation of athletic motion on humanoid robots. In this paper, we propose to make a step toward this objective by reformulating classic DDP as an implicit optimal control problem, allowing the use of more advanced integration schemes such as implicit or variational integrators. To that end, we introduce a primal-dual proximal Lagrangian approach capable of handling dynamic and path constraints in a unified manner, while taking advantage of the time sparsity inherent to optimal control problems. We show that his reformulation enables us to relax the dynamics along the optimization process by solving it inexactly: far from the optimality conditions, the dynamics are only partially fulfilled, but continuously enforced as the solver get closer to the local optimal solution. This inexactness enables our approach to robustly handle large time steps (100 ms or more), unlike other DDP solvers of the state of the art, as experimentally validated through different robotic scenarios.},

  abstract = {Recent strides in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) underscore a dependence on numerical advancements to efficiently and accurately solve large-scale problems. Given the substantial number of variables characterizing typical whole-body optimal control (OC) problems —often numbering in the thousands— exploiting the sparse structure of the numerical problem becomes crucial to meet computational demands, typically in the range of a few milliseconds. Addressing the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problem is a fundamental building block for computing Newton or Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) steps in direct optimal control methods. This paper concentrates on equality-constrained problems featuring implicit system dynamics and dual regularization, a characteristic of advanced interiorpoint or augmented Lagrangian solvers. Here, we introduce a parallel algorithm for solving an LQR problem with dual regularization. Leveraging a rewriting of the LQR recursion through block elimination, we first enhanced the efficiency of the serial algorithm and then subsequently generalized it to handle parametric problems. This extension enables us to split decision variables and solve multiple subproblems concurrently. Our algorithm is implemented in our nonlinear numerical optimal control library ALIGATOR. It showcases improved performance over previous serial formulations and we validate its efficacy by deploying it in the model predictive control of a real quadruped robot.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization has been a popular choice for motion generation and control in robotics for at least a decade. Several numerical approaches have exhibited the required speed to enable online computation of trajectories for real-time of various systems, including complex robots. Many of these said are based on the differential dynamic programming (DDP) algorithm – initially designed for unconstrained trajectory optimization problems – and its variants, which are relatively easy to implement and provide good runtime performance. However, several problems in robot control call for using constrained formulations (e.g. torque limits, obstacle avoidance), from which several difficulties arise when trying to adapt DDP-type methods: numerical stability, computational efficiency, and constraint satisfaction. In this article, we leverage proximal methods for constrained optimization and introduce a DDP-type method for fast, constrained trajectory optimization suited for model-predictive control (MPC) applications with easy warm-starting. Compared to earlier solvers, our approach effectively manages hard constraints without warm-start limitations and exhibits good convergence behavior. We provide a complete implementation as part of an open-source and flexible C++ trajectory optimization library called ALIGATOR. These algorithmic contributions are validated through several trajectory planning scenarios from the robotics literature and the real-time whole-body MPC of a quadruped robot.},

In these applications, the focus is on constrained optimization, and the ability to work on manifolds (such as the classical matrix Lie groups), along with a specific requirement for robustness and speed. In recent years, augmented Lagrangian methods have seen a resurgence due to their robustness and flexibility, their connections to (inexact) proximal-point methods, and their interoperability with Newton or semismooth Newton methods. In the sequel, we present primal-dual augmented Lagrangian method for inequality-constrained problems on manifolds, which we introduced in our recent work, as well as an efficient C++ implementation suitable for use in robotics applications and beyond.}

  abstract = {Physics simulation is ubiquitous in robotics. Whether in model-based approaches (e.g., trajectory optimization), or model-free algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning), physics simulators are a central component of modern control pipelines in robotics. Over the past decades, several robotic simulators have been developed, each with dedicated contact modeling assumptions and algorithmic solutions. In this article, we survey the main contact models and the associated numerical methods commonly used in robotics for simulating advanced robot motions involving contact interactions. In particular, we recall the physical laws underlying contacts and friction (i.e., Signorini condition, Coulomb's law, and the maximum dissipation principle), and how they are transcribed in current simulators. For each physics engine, we expose their inherent physical relaxations along with their limitations due to the numerical techniques employed. Based on our study, we propose theoretically grounded quantitative criteria on which we build benchmarks assessing both the physical and computational aspects of simulation. We support our work with an open-source and efficient C++ implementation of the existing algorithmic variations. Our results demonstrate that some approximations or algorithms commonly used in robotics can severely widen the reality gap and impact target applications. We hope this work will help motivate the development of new contact models, contact solvers, and robotic simulators in general, at the root of recent progress in motion generation in robotics.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) and trajectory opti-mization (TO) present strong complementary advantages. On one hand, RL approaches are able to learn global control policies directly from data, but generally require large sample sizes to properly converge towards feasible policies. On the other hand, TO methods are able to exploit gradient-based information extracted from simulators to quickly converge towards a locally optimal control trajectory which is only valid within the vicinity of the solution. Over the past decade, several approaches have aimed to adequately combine the two classes of methods in order to obtain the best of both worlds. Following on from this line of research, we propose several improvements on top of these approaches to learn global control policies quicker, notably by leveraging sensitivity information stemming from TO methods via Sobolev learning, and Augmented Lagrangian (AL) techniques to enforce the consensus between TO and policy learning. We evaluate the benefits of these improvements on various classical tasks in robotics through comparison with existing approaches in the literature.}

Yet, TO methods remain limited to robots with tens of degrees of freedom (DoFs), limiting their usage in soft robotics, where kinematic models may require hundreds of DoFs in general. In this work, we introduce a generic method to perform trajectory optimization based on continuum mechanics to describe the behavior of soft robots. The core idea is to condense the dynamics of the soft robot in the constraint space in order to obtain a reduced dynamics formulation, which can then be plugged into numerical TO methods. In particular, we show that these condensed dynamics can be easily coupled with differential dynamic programming methods for solving TO problems involving soft robots. This method is evaluated on three different soft robots with different geometries and actuation.},
